\chapter{Treasure}

The fortress was cool inside, with a breeze gently passing them from deeper within the hill.  It smelled damp, and old.  Tarn guessed that this was only the surface level, and that below it there was much more to be seen.

Once inside the entrance he looked to the left, and saw a short passage leading to a wooden door.  He led the party to the door, with Peter and Circe ducking under beams and taking care not to hit their heads on the dwarf-built ceiling.  Opening the door, Tarn found a small study, just as the voice had told him.  It contained many books, tablets and scrolls, as well as a number of maps hanging on the walls with varying amounts of annotation and sketches upon them.  There was a desk too, cluttered with documents and opened books, and samples of rock and metal that appeared to be under study.

On a shelf on the far wall, Tarn saw a glint of light and the shiny surface of a polished, teal-coloured metal.  His heart began to beat faster as he walked towards the shelf.  The object was under a pile of papers, which Tarn carefully removed and placed on the floor by his feet.  He reached up and grabbed the metal object.  It was a sword.

``Is that it?'' Circe asked quietly, reverently.  ``K\=\i{}ldir?''

Tarn beheld it.  It was indeed teal colored; polished but not very sharp.  It was fairly long for a dwarf, reaching from about his waist to the floor.  The hilt was not wrapped in leather; perhaps it had deteriorated long ago, if the sword were as ancient as he hoped it was.  There was a pattern finely engraved on the blade, a motif of water drops and flowing lines---different than the straight edges and geometric patterns common to dwarf workmanship in his experience, but no less impressive for that difference.  Clearly every part of the sword was made with particular care, as if its makers intended it for some grand ceremonial use, or a particularly distinguished client.  Tarn held it close to his face, inspecting it.  On the base of the blade, right below the hilt, he found a small Dwarven inscription:

\dwarvenInscription{Kildir}

\emph{K\=\i{}ldir}.  There was no other word engraved there; no mention of the sword's creators, or the place or time in which it was made.  But what was there was enough: this was the treasure for which he had come here.

Tarn had many attractive possessions back home in Korbarthrond: his scale model of the mountain made from Omunkorb, his jewelry, his coins of gold and silver \ldots\ even his guard's uniform was beautiful in its own way, both functional and handsome.  His hammer was finely decorated and he maintained it well.  Despite these, there was no doubt in Tarn's mind that this teal sword now in front of him was the most beautiful object that his hands had ever held.  It filled him with emotion: satisfaction that his quest was complete; wonder at its mystery; awe at its antiquity and its legend.  Tarn imagined hanging it in his quarters; showing it to his friends and peers; holding it aloft and imagining the great deeds of the past.  Reciting \emph{The Land of Sea} and bragging about the elves and the Tholkis and the challenges that he had overcome in order to win the sword.
