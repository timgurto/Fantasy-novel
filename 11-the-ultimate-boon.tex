Tarn returned the sword yet again to his belt, and carefully stowed the piece of metal in a small pouch.  The realisation that it really could save his city had softened the blow of its being damaged, and he now took care to preserve every piece of the metal that he could.

``That dwarf came out of here,'' Circe said, pointing down a fork.  ``My guess is that if \mothzam\ is in these tunnels, we'll find him this way.''

The others had no reason to disagree, so they followed Circe and her light.  There were no more forks in the path, and before long they came to yet another wooden door in a rough stone doorway.  They could see a glow around the door here, too, but this time it was a bright blue in colour.

``This might be \mothzam,'' whispered Circe.  ``Make sure you're ready.''

Tarn drew his sword and hammer.  Peter summoned a holy shield around the three of them.  They exchanged a nod, and Tarn opened the door.

This room was less rough than the one containing the elemental.  The floor was flattened, the walls and ceiling smoothed.  The corners and edges of the room were encrusted with ice.  Around the walls, Dwarven glyphs were carved into the stone and glowed faintly with that same unearthly blue that could be seen from outside.

A dwarf stood facing the wall to the left, wearing a black hooded robe.  His left hand was outstretched to touch the blue glyphs, and his right held a wooden staff.  At the top of the staff was what looked like a small brazier, and it held a glass orb containing a glowing blue liquid.  The dwarf continued to focus on the glyphs under his hand, seemingly ignoring the trespassers.  His eyes too seemed to glow as they reflected the blue light, and each of his breaths hung like a cloud in the cold air before dissipating.  Falling from his face was a long beard: untrimmed, disheveled, and bright red.

``\mothzam\ \driktur,'' Tarn affirmed.  The dwarf at the table opened his mouth to speak, but his body and eyes remained fixated on the wall in front of him.

``Why have you intruded here?'' he asked in a distracted, unemotional voice.

``We found the elemental.  Imprisoned, neglected, tortured by years of decay and stagnation.  How could any cause justify that level of cruelty?''  The two spoke Dwarven to each other.  All Peter and Circe could do was pay attention to the tone each of them used when speaking, and remain ready for combat should it come to that.

``The creature is mine, and I will do with him as I wish.  If I prefer him to be encumbered by filth, then so will it be.''

Tarn stepped forward, and held up \kildir.  ``I have purified him.''

\mothzam\ turned his head towards them and looked at the sword; he saw the truth of Tarn's words in the shining metal.  His face hardened as he slowly turned the rest of his body.  He withdrew his hand from the glyphs in the wall, to instead hold the staff with both hands.  It began to glow blue along its entire length.  \mothzam pointed the staff at Tarn menacingly.

``Do you know the history of that blade?'' he asked Tarn, now sounding angry.

``I know it came from a floating city which is now sunk.  I know it was used to purify their water, thousands of years ago.''

``And what do you think of its quality?''

Tarn was honest.  ``It is a beautiful artefact, made with unparalleled care and craftsmanship.  I deeply regret the damage it has taken.''

``It is a relic of \valdunmir, the lost dwarven city.  It is but one example of the wondrous works that came from that city, but you can be sure that there were entire industries, over decades or centuries, producing goods just as impressive as that sword.  An entire culture, lost to the seas.''

This produced in Tarn a deep sense of longing; nostalgia for a culture he didn't remember or know.  Desire for the treasures of which \mothzam had spoken.

``And not just small handcrafts,'' the robed dwarf continued. ``The city itself was a marvel.  Constructed of iron, yet floating above the seas.  Sprawling gardens and mighty towers.  Engineering and construction unparalleled even now by Dwarves or Men.''

``None of this justifies years of torture, and a dead city cannot be resurrected.''

``It can!'' snapped \mothzam.  ``The machines and platforms sit idle on the bottom of the sea, ready to be restored.  The materials and goods still fill the flooded storehouses.  The people are drowned, but their culture and knowledge still live in the libraries and records, waiting to be drawn up from the waves.

``And I had a way to do it.  The frost elemental I captured, whom you so kindly gave a bath, has power over the seas.  He and his kin could have reversed the calamity that befell \valdunmir, and brought it back to the surface.  All he needed was the right motivation.  And he was close to his breaking point; I know it!  Now you have ruined those years of work.''

``He's free of that now.  Just let him go, if he is no longer any good to you,'' pleaded Tarn.

``Nonsense.  I can find other ways to encourage him.  But you, on the other hand \ldots\ I can see in the way you hold that sword, the way you listened to my words: you understand the value of the prize I describe.''  Tarn said nothing.

``Join me.  Join my team, and help me to restore the glory that was lost; the glory of our people!''

Tarn answered in the Human language in order to warn the others what was coming.  ``You have gone mad with greed.  With dreams that can never be fulfilled.  I will not join you.''

Before anybody could react, \mothzam\ thrust his staff towards Peter.  A beam of blue light shot out of it, and an explosion of steam and white powder erupted where it hit him.  Peter ceased all movement, as he was now encased in a massive lump of ice.
