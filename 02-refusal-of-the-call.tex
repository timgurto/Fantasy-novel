\chapter{Adventure}
Tarn walked slowly back towards his quarters, trying to comprehend what had just happened.  He'd been asked by the king to go on a journey: days of road travel, to a Human town.  Tarn had never strayed far from the mountain, and had slept every night of his life within Kobarthrond.  He shuddered.

Could he abandon his guard responsibilties to go on this mission?  There was a sense of duty drilled into him through years of training and following orders.  But this was an order from King Athzad himself!  Surely he was just making excuses at this point.  Finding himself suddenly desiring counsel, he turned and, instead of going home, went to visit a close friend.  Tarn followed the corridor until he came to the door with the desired inscription:

\dwarvenInscription{orvi kogugim}

\emph{Orvi, son of Kog}.  A metalworker, Kog had been Tarn's friend since childhood.  Tarn knocked on the door.  A moment later the door opened.

``Tarn?''

``Hello Orvi.  Can I come in?  Something is troubling me.''

``Of course, of course!''  Orvi stepped aside, allowing Tarn to enter the apartment.

Like Tarn, Orvi's home was decorated with a number of crafted goods, but in this case most of them had been made by Orvi himself.  Hanging on the far wall was a large knife, its shiny steel blade etched with words---probably merely ceremonial or decorative; it didn't look to Tarn like it had ever been used.  On Orvi's table were a fruitbowl and water jug, made from bronze with elaborate patterns engraved on them and shapes dancing around the rims.   Sitting on a shelf above the fireplace was a row of small ingots of various metals, perfectly shaped and polished to a mirror finish.  Other shelves and furniture proudly displayed various machinery, figures, and coins, all metal and all beautiful.  Upon seeing these fine creations---and, almost as a reflex, thinking about the work and care that went into them---Tarn quickly calmed down, feeling at peace.

He sat at the table, and looked first at the water jug and then at Orvi.  ``There's a problem with the city's water supply.''  After reflecting for a moment, Tarn added, ''the king asked me not to spread it widely and create a panic, so please keep this to yourself.''

Orvi nodded.  ``Are you sure? I went down to the well just this morning.  I get water every day to quench my work, and I haven't noticed any issues.''

``The wells are still operating, and open for industrial uses.  We just can't use them to get drinking water.  Some sort of poison, apparently.

``I disagreed with the king's planned course of action, and he strongarmed me into making an inquiry with the Men in Hamlet.''

``What \emph{was} the king's planned course?'' Orvi asked.

``One team is searching the mines for new wells or leaked streams.  Another is starting to haul water in from the river.  The city is also buying water from Hamlet---my friend Lawrence brought some in just this week.''

``And you don't think those will work?''

``Not in the long term, no,'' Tarn answered.  ''I think the search will fail, and the other two approaches are too expensive or impractical.''

Orvi nodded slowly.  The silence made Tarn feel uncomfortable; defensive.  ``You disagree?''

``I think they're worth trying.  After all, we need to do something.  What are you supposed to do in Hamlet?"

``The king wants me to ask around, and see if I can find any advanced technology or medicine that can help us.  It was my suggestion; all he did was volunteer me for the job."

Orvi knew how close Tarn was with his Human friend Lawrence, and that he had a soft spot for Men in general.  ``You seem optimistic."

``Less pessimistic, maybe.  But I still feel uncomfortable about the whole thing."

``About your chances?''

``No,'' Tarn answered, ``about leaving for Hamlet.''

``Ahh,'' sighed Orvi sympathetically.  ``It's natural to want to stay here, underground; straying outside is asking for trouble.  So don't discount your gut feeling about this journey."

``But don't you think it's worth trying, even if I \emph{am} scared, for the sake of the city?''

Orvi thought for a moment, and then spoke slowly, deliberately.  ``If you want my honest answer, I think you're being too idealistic about the Men.  They don't have the answer for everything.  I don't think you're going to find much out there.  And in the mean time, it sounds like the king has things under control.''
