Tarn walked slowly back towards his quarters, trying to comprehend what had just happened.  He'd been asked by the king to go on a journey: days of road travel, to a Human town.  Tarn had never strayed far from the mountain, and had slept every night of his life within Kobarthrond.  He shuddered.

Could he abandon his guard responsibilties to go on this mission?  There was a sense of duty drilled into him through years of training and following orders.  But this was an order from King Athzad himself!  Surely he was just making excuses at this point.  Finding himself suddenly desiring counsel, he turned and, instead of going home, decided to visit a close friend.  Tarn followed the corridor until he came to the door with the desired inscription:

\dwarvenInscription{orvi kogugim}

\emph{Orvi, son of Kog}.  A metalworker, Orvi had been Tarn's friend since childhood.  Tarn knocked on the door.  About a minute later, the door opened.

``Tarn?''  Orvi rubbed his eyes.  He was wearing his bedclothes and holding a lantern.

``Hello my friend.  I'm sorry for calling so late, but something's troubling me.''

``Of course, come in!''  Orvi stepped aside, allowing Tarn to enter the apartment.  He turned up the lantern and hung it on the wall to illuminate the sitting room.

Like Tarn's, Orvi's home was decorated with a number of crafted goods, but here most of them had been made by Orvi himself.  Hanging on the far wall was a large knife, its shiny steel blade etched with words---probably merely ceremonial or decorative; it didn't look to Tarn like it had ever been used.  On Orvi's table were a fruitbowl and water jug, made from bronze with elaborate patterns engraved on them and delicate moulded shapes dancing around the rims.   Sitting on a shelf above the fireplace was a row of small ingots, perfectly shaped and polished to a mirror finish, each of a different metal.  Other shelves and furniture proudly displayed various machinery, figures, and coins, all metal and all beautiful.  Upon seeing these fine creations---and, almost as a reflex, thinking about the work and care that went into them---Tarn quickly calmed down, feeling at peace.

He sat at the table, and looked first at the water jug and then at Orvi.  ``There's a problem with the city's water supply.''  After reflecting for a moment, Tarn added, ''the king asked me not to spread it widely and create a panic, so please keep this to yourself.''

Orvi nodded.  ``What kind of problem? I went down to the well just this morning.  I use water every day to quench my pieces of work, and I haven't noticed any issues.''

``The wells are still operating, and open for industrial uses.  We just can't use them to get drinking water.  Some sort of poison, apparently."  Tarn sighed.  ``I disagreed with the king's planned course of action, and in exchange he strongarmed me into journeying to Hamlet.''

``What \emph{was} the king's planned course, which you found so disagreeable?'' Orvi asked.

``One team is searching the mines for new wells or underground streams.  Another is starting to haul water in from the river.  The city is also buying water from Hamlet---my friend Lawrence brought some in just this week.''

``And you don't think those will work?''

``Not in the long term, no,'' Tarn answered.  ''I think the search will fail, and the other two approaches are too expensive or impractical.''

Orvi nodded slowly.  The silence made Tarn feel uncomfortable; defensive.  ``You disagree?''

``I think they're worth trying.  After all, we need to do something.  What are you supposed to do in Hamlet?"

``The king wants me to ask around, and see if I can find any advanced technology or medicine that can help us.  It was my suggestion, actually; all he did was volunteer me for the job.''

Orvi knew how close Tarn was with his Human friend Lawrence, and that he had a soft spot for Men in general.  ``You seem optimistic about it.''

``Less pessimistic than about the other ideas, I suppose.  But I still feel uncomfortable about the whole thing."

``About your chances?''

``No,'' Tarn answered, ``about leaving for Hamlet.''

``Ahh,'' sighed Orvi sympathetically.  ``It's natural to want to stay here, underground; straying outside is asking for trouble.  So don't discount your gut feeling about this journey.''

``But don't you think it's worth trying, even if I \emph{am} scared, for the sake of the city?''

Orvi thought for a moment, and then spoke slowly, deliberately.  ``If you want my honest answer, I think you're being too idealistic about the Men.  They don't have the answer for everything.  I don't think you're going to find much out there.  And in the mean time, it sounds like the king has things under control.''

His friend's confidence gave Tarn some relief.  He thanked Orvi for his time, wished him well, and left.  It had been a long evening of merry reunions and sobering discussion, and eventually Tarn managed to get to sleep.

\chapter{Adventure}

The next day Tarn was again on duty, posted at one of the city's banks.  At least by working he was able to contribute---who knows how much time he could have wasted by travelling, and with the possibility of no benefit!

But it was hard to focus on his work.  The water problem still gnawed at him, pulling at his attention constantly.  \emph{How long can the city survive without drinking water?  How long could the citizens survive off beer, wine, and whatever dribbles of water could be imported?  How long could the economy bear those endless imports?}  There was no guarantee that a new water source could be found.  And if one was, who was to say that it wouldn't share the same taint as the city's existing wells?  He could remain here, living his life, patrolling, and ignoring the problem \ldots{} but what good was it to guard a city when that city was dying?

Could he in good conscience stand by while this crisis unfolded?  He was nobody special; not an alchemist or a plumber, with expertise in the problem.  And certainly not an adventurer or scholar, with the ability to find the solution. But unlike most others, \emph{he} knew about the problem; \emph{he} believed in the outside chance of a solution being out there; and what's more, \emph{he alone} had been ordered by his king to go and do this.

All three of these points resonated, humming in Tarn's mind like harpstrings.  If he didn't go, who else would?  Who else would believe in the possibility of an answer, and thus be sincerely driven to find it?  Where would a more cynical Dwarf draw the line and say `sorry Your Majesty, but you were right---there's nothing out there that can help us'?

No \ldots{} it had to be him.  But that was easier said than done; Tarn had never left the shadow of the mountain.  He didn't know where to go, or whom to meet, or what to ask, or even what he should pack.  So he drew a line around this adventure: it would be small; controlled.  He \emph{would} travel to Hamlet, but only to its library.  There, he would ask if there was some obvious solution---that is, obvious to Men but not to the Dwarves of Kobarthrond.  Then, whatever the answer, he would come home and report his findings to the king.

Having a plan made Tarn more relaxed: it was under control.  He'd go, then come back.

After his shift, Tarn went to visit Lawrence at the inn.  The trader was still in Kobarthrond, and Tarn found him at the inn's stables, loading his cart with crates.

``Lawrence, my friend!'' he called out.  ``Are you leaving the mountain?''

``Tomorrow at sunrise, yes.  Come to say goodbye?''

``As a matter of fact, I came to ask if I could accompany you back to Hamlet.''

Lawrence was taken aback.  ``Uhh, sure!  I must say, I'm surprised---in all our years of friendship I've never known you to be the traveling type.''

``I'm not.  Last night after our parting, I spoke with the king.  There \emph{is} a problem with the water supply after all.  This is confidential, but''---he lowered his voice---``the city's wells are poisoned, and are making a large number of persons sick.  He asked me to travel to Hamlet, and see if the Men know of a solution.''
