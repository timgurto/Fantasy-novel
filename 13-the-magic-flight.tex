Then the elemntal asked, ``where does your quest take you now?  Can I offer any service to you, as thanks for freeing me?''

``We return now to Treeville, to return to her people the belongings and story of our fallen friend.''

``There is a river delta near these hills, which leads upstream to Treeville.  I can travel swift and strong in such waters, and I would be honored to carry both of you there.''

Tarn and Peter exchanged a look, then Tarn shrugged and said, ``that sounds like an unmissable opportunity.  Please do.''

There were three companions now, advancing up the gradated tunnel, up the stairs then out the gate of the hill fortress.  Night had fallen when they reached the fresh air, so Tarn and Peter crept out and into cover, while the elemental followed them as quietly as he could.  A constant sound of running water followed him, as parts of him splashed to the ground before coalescing back into him.  They quickly headed west, out of the hills and towards the river delta.

Upon reaching the water, the elemental instructed Tarn and Peter to wade into the water, and to hold their breaths until comfortable with the movement.  They did so.  Suddenly, a great force pushed them forward, like a wave that never ended.  After a few moments they began breathing again, careful not to inhale any of the water that rushed constantly at their faces.  With the elemental pushing them from behind, and the water in front of them pushing against the movement, they struggled to hold onto everything.  Looking at the nearby land, Tarn saw that they were moving at phenomenal speed, at least twice as fast as a swift horse.  In less than an hour, they saw Treeville appear in the distance, and very soon after that they were in the elven woods.
