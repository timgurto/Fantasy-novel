Then the elemntal asked, ``where does your quest take you now?''

``We return now to Treeville, to brief lord Elrond about what occurred here, and to return to her people the belongings and story of our fallen friend.''

``There is a river delta near these hills, which leads upstream to Treeville.  I can travel swiftly and powerfully in such waters, and I would be honored to carry both of you there.''

Tarn and Peter exchanged a look, then Tarn shrugged and said, ``that sounds like an unmissable opportunity.''

There were three companions now, advancing up the gradated tunnel, up the stairs then out the gate of the hill fortress.  The air was fresh, but chilling; it was the coldest part of the night, just before dawn.  Tarn and Peter crept out and into cover in case anybody in the village was watching, while the elemental followed them as quietly as he could.  The constant sound of agitated water followed him, as parts of him splashed to the ground before coalescing back into him.  They quickly headed west, out of the hills, until they reached the river delta.

``Wade into the water,'' instructed the elemental.

Tarn and Peter did so gingerly, bristling at the cold water and careful to hold their belongings tightly.  The elemental followed them into the river, crying with delight at the sensation.

``It has been so long!  So long since I have felt other water.''

He soon returned to his normal humourlessness, and continued his advice.  ``Hold your breaths.  When you are accustomed to the movement, and the water in your faces, you may trust yourselves to breathe again.''  Tarn and Peter, now shivering in the cold water, took deep breaths.  The elemental then moved behind them, and suddenly a great force pushed them forward, like a wave that never ended.  After a few moments they began breathing again, careful to inhale air instead of the water that rushed constantly at them from all directions.  With the elemental pushing them from behind, and the water in front of them pushing against the movement, they struggled to hold onto everything.  Looking at the nearby land, Tarn saw that they were moving at phenomenal speed, at least twice as fast as a swift horse, and faster than any running water he had ever seen.  In less than an hour, they saw Treeville appear in the distance, and very soon after that, as the pink light of dawn began filling the gaps between the trees, they found themselves in the depths of the elven woods.

``Go on into the village without me, my friends,'' said the elemental.  ``Though it would please me to meet with this elf lord, I cannot yet bear to leave the water.  I will linger here until noon, in these slow and clear elven waters, so that you may speak with me again if you so wish.''

Tarn and Peter bowed to the elemental, then turned to enter the village.   They were soaking wet, and shivered as the morning wind hit them, yet they were still so thrilled by the rapid journey they had just taken that they hardly noticed the cold.  The leaf cover crunched under their feet as they reached the large tree in which they had twice met with Elrond.

The guard at the base of the tree saw them coming.  ``Are you the man and the dwarf who rested here recently?'' he asked in broken Human.

``Yes,'' replied Peter, faring better in his native tongue than Tarn would, as before.  ``We seek an audience with Lord Elrond.''
