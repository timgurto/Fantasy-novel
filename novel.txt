Freedom to Live
    Protag wakes up for a regular day of work.  He glances at the shield hanging on his wall: too beautiful to use, not part of his allowed uniform, and probably not as strong has his issued shield given that it was ceremonial.  But a reminder of his adventure.  Below it is a small shelf with the hilt of the sword, and the box with the coin, open.
    He puts on his uniform and heads to the mess hall.  With his breakfast he has a mug of beer, and then a mug of water, admiring its clean taste.  Atlantis may be gone, but its technology lives on in Orehome, keeping it afloat.  Beginning his day of work guarding the city, he can protect it and keep it alive, satisfying that part of him that wanted to restore Atlantis.
