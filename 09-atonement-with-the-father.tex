Tarn could find no sheath for the longsword, and so he tucked it into his belt.  The three companions then left the study and returned to the main hall.  It was straight and level, with a small window in the distance allowing a dash of the afternoon sun to overpower the torches lining the walls.  Moving down the hall, Tarn spotted a doorway to the right, and poking his head through he found staircase going down.

``Shall we bring a torch?'' he asked, gesturing at the nearest one on the wall.

``No need,'' answered Circe, holding up her staff and muttering until a small flame began dancing on its tip.  ``It isn't very hot, but it's bright,'' she explained.  Circe then led the party carefully down the stairs.  It led to another hallway, but completely underground.  Its floors were paved, and the walls and ceiling were raw stone.  Rough and undecorated, Tarn noted with distate.  This hall still appeared to be straight, but it was inclined fairly heavily, with the only direction heading down.  So down they went.

The party met no other person while walking farther and deeper.  Torches continued to pepper the walls, and Circe's staff provided ample light.  Over time, the hall became cruder.  The paved floor gave way to natural stone, and it seemed to have become more of a rough tunnel than a hall in a large building.  The ground and walls then became dank, with patches of green algae and small puddles of stagnant water.
