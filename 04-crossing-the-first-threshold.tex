Tarn and Peter had been traveling for a few days, and were now settling down for their fourth night camped off the road.  By now Tarn was getting used to the traveler's life: he knew how to find firewood, what sort and how much to collect; he could hunt with some success; and with each passing night he was getting to sleep easier.

On this night, however, it began to rain, which was a phenomenon to which Tarn was very much unaccustomed.  They were camped underneath some trees to give their fire some degree of shelter from the wind, and they had fixed a sheet to the trunks, covering the ground, so that they could sleep without getting too wet.  Even so, it was miserable and cold, with water getting everywhere, and Tarn knew that he would never get to sleep.  He glanced over and saw Peter lying with his eyes closed, but couldn't be sure whether he was asleep, or merely trying to will himself so.

A flash of lightning lit up the sky, and suddenly Tarn heard intense, excited growling, from all around them.  He jumped up, hammer in hand, and yelled to Peter to wake up.  He glanced around in the dim light, and saw the fire's weak flickering reflected in three, four \ldots\  at least five monstrous faces, surrounding the camp.

``Goblins!'' Peter yelled.  The creatures were small, shorter than Tarn and much thinner.  They had pale greyish skin, long ears and noses, and wrinkled, sneering faces.  They wore crude clothing: tattered rags, with the odd leather jerkin or pauldrons that were presumably looted from some other unfortunate travelers.  They held clubs and rocks at the ready.

Having lost the element of surprise, the goblins began to advance slowly.

``Do you know how to fight?'' Tarn shouted over the sound of the rain.

``No!  I've never needed to!'' came Peter's reply.

``Hold your stick close, and hit any that come near!''

Tarn stared at the goblins, slowly crouching down to pick up his shield.  He got up suddenly, and at that, three of them lunged at Tarn.  He held up the shield to deflect the initial blows, then lowered it slightly so that he could see.  One goblin remained in front of him; the other two had retreated after their first blows.  Tarn swung his hammer, and sent the goblin flying, dead.

He glanced over at Peter.  Two goblins circled around him, with the poor cleric holding up his stick as if it would ward them off.  Tarn yelled ``Come at me, you ugly things!'', and one of them turned to pursue Tarn instead.  At least now Peter had only one to deal with.

While he was distracted, one of the other
